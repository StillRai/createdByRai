                    Welcome to my tech journey — a series of happy accidents and questionable decisions! It all
                    started back in 2003 when I was voluntold into <span class="text-custom-lightgreen">web
                        design</span> by Mom (thanks, Mom!). From there, I made the oh-so-wise choice of <span
                        class="text-custom-lightgreen">Joomla</span> over <span
                        class="text-custom-lightgreen">WordPress</span>, because why make life easy?
                </span>
                <br> <br>
                <span class="theJourney-content">
                    I then spent countless hours mastering <span class="text-custom-lightgreen">Flash</span> for
                    <span class="text-custom-lightgreen">web development</span> (RIP, my masterpiece), and
                    decided to dabble in <span class="text-custom-lightgreen">PHP</span> to alter <span
                        class="text-custom-lightgreen">Joomla templates</span> — just enough to get the job
                    done. During my time working as an underwriter at <span class="text-custom-lightgreen">HSBC</span>,
                    tech remained my constant hobby. Throughout
                    various customer service roles, tech was always there in the background. It's been a wild
                    ride, and who knows what tech mishap I'll stumble into next?
